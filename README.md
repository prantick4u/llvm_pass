# llvm_pass

An LLVM pass is a modular unit of code that analyzes or transforms LLVM intermediate representation (IR) during compilation.
It enables optimizations, instrumentation, or code transformations, forming the core of LLVM‚Äôs flexible compiler pipeline.


## üîß Real-Life Examples of LLVM Passes

LLVM passes are essential for optimizing and transforming code during compilation. Here are some practical examples used in real-world systems:

### üöÄ Common Optimization Passes

- **Dead Code Elimination (DCE):**  
  Removes unused instructions or functions to reduce binary size and improve execution speed.

- **Loop Unrolling:**  
  Expands loops into multiple repeated statements to reduce branching and enable vectorization.

- **Function Inlining:**  
  Replaces function calls with the function's body to eliminate call overhead and expose further optimization opportunities.

### üß™ Analysis and Debugging Passes

- **AddressSanitizer (ASan):**  
  Instruments code to detect memory errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and stack corruption at runtime.

- **GCOV Profiling Pass:**  
  Injects profiling counters into the IR to measure code coverage during test runs.

### üõ°Ô∏è Custom & Security-Oriented Passes

- **Security Hardening Pass:**  
  Inserts stack canaries or bounds checks to mitigate buffer overflow and other common attack vectors.

- **Custom Logging/Tracing Pass:**  
  Adds logging statements to monitor function entry/exit or variable usage for profiling and debugging.

These passes illustrate the flexibility and power of LLVM's modular pass infrastructure, which enables fine-grained control over code transformation and analysis workflows.
