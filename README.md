# llvm_pass

An LLVM pass is a modular unit of code that analyzes or transforms LLVM intermediate representation (IR) during compilation.
It enables optimizations, instrumentation, or code transformations, forming the core of LLVM’s flexible compiler pipeline.


## 🛠️ Real-World Use Cases of LLVM Passes

LLVM passes play a central role in modern compiler toolchains. Below are real-world scenarios where they’re used:

- **🔄 Code Optimization:**
  - *Dead Code Elimination:* Strips unused code to reduce binary size.
  - *Loop Unrolling:* Expands loops to reduce control overhead and improve performance.
  - *Function Inlining:* Substitutes function calls with actual function bodies to expose optimization opportunities.

- **🧪 Instrumentation & Debugging:**
  - *AddressSanitizer:* Detects memory issues like buffer overflows and use-after-free at runtime.
  - *GCOV Profiling:* Instruments code to track code coverage during testing.

- **🛡️ Security Enhancements:**
  - *Stack Protection:* Injects stack canaries to prevent stack smashing.
  - *Bounds Checking:* Adds runtime bounds checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.

- **📊 Custom Analysis:**
  - *Function Logging:* Inserts custom logging to trace function entry/exit.
  - *Profiling Hooks:* Adds counters or timers for performance monitoring.

These examples show how LLVM passes are not only crucial for optimization but also for security, testing, and introspection in real-world software systems.
